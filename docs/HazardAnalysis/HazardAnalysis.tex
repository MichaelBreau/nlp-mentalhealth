\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of this hazard analysis is to identify potential risks to stakeholders and the failure modes of the software that lead to these risks being realized. The document only covers stakeholder losses caused by a failure of our software system as the focus is on guiding the design of the system, not defining all possible stakeholder losses. The document identifies potential hazards in the system and from these derives a set of security requirements that will be used to refine our system design.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

        & An nlp pipeline breaks on deployment
        & Loss of time to try different models and approaches during the eRisk competition
        & Lack of comprehensive validation systems before deployment

        \multirow{1}{*}{Risk Prediction} 
        & Corrupted data causes incorrect model results
        & Model gives a wrong prediction, impacts success in the eRisk competition and could result in an incorrect diagnosis
        & Data is distorted in some way (entries duplicated, deleted, changed, etc.)
        & System will check data to ensure it is intact before it is given to the model
        & SR6, SR7
        & TBD \\

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
