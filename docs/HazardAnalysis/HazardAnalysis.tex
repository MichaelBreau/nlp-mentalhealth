\section{Introduction}

This document is used for the analysis of possible hazards that could affect the NLP Early Risk Detection of Mental Health Issues project. The definition of a hazard as used in this document is any potential cause for a loss to the interests of the stakeholders of the project. The purpose of this document is to aid with resolving potential risks for hazards before they become an issue.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of this hazard analysis is to identify potential risks to stakeholders and the failure modes of the software that lead to these risks being realized. The document only covers stakeholder losses caused by a failure of our software system as the focus is on guiding the design of the system, not defining all possible stakeholder losses. The document identifies potential hazards in the system and from these derives a set of security requirements that will be used to refine our system design.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The system that the hazard analysis with be conducted on consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system's security/ethical aspects which consist of the following:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Data ingestion component
		      \item Data processing component
		      \item Algorithm bias feature
		      \item Data protection component
	      \end{itemize}
	The major concern of this system is the security of user data provided by E-Risk. It must be known that data leaks from the system would be a potential hazard to these users. Data ingestion, processing, protection components of the system must be analyzed. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

        & Hardware Limitation (Crashes or not enough processing power)
        & Loss of trust from users, in the case of this project specifically: potential poor results at eRisk competition
        & Process causes device to crash, processes errors out unexpectedly, or the code is unable to complete in a time constraint that makes sense 
        & The system should be thoroughly tested as well as account for edge cases that could possibly lead to one of the previously mentioned failures

        & The team through tools as well as themselves hold themselves accountable to their code as the wellbeing of others can be affected by it

        & Corrupted data causes incorrect model results
        & Model gives a wrong prediction, impacts success in the eRisk competition and could result in an incorrect diagnosis
        & Data is distorted in some way (entries duplicated, deleted, changed, etc.)
        & System will check data to ensure it is intact before it is given to the model

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[SR1.] User data must not be shared or re-used in any system not part of this system
    \item[] \emph{Rationale:}  As users have an expectation that their personal data will be handled with care, sharing it with other systems will not guarantee their safety as it will not be under our control.
    \item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H1-1

    \item[SR2.] Sensitive user data is must not be present within the results generated
    \item[] \emph{Rationale:}  This is to ensure legal compliance and uphold ethical and professional standards. In addition, exposing people's PPI could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or privacy violations.
    \item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H1-1
\end{enumerate}

Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
