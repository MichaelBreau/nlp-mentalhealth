=== (E.2) Components

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _List of elements of the environment that may affect or be affected by the system and project. It includes other systems to which the system must be interfaced. These components may include existing systems, particularly software systems, with which the system will interact â€” by using their APIs (program interfaces), or by providing APIs to them, or both. These are interfaces provided to the system from the outside world. They are distinct from both: interfaces provided by the system to the outside world (<<s3>>); and technology elements that the system's development will require (<<p5>>)._  <<BM22>>

- *Message Servers*: The system must utilize servers provided by ERisk for when we validate our system during the testing stage to interatively get user writings and send responses (This is the scope of the operations teams project).

- *Text Data and Profiles*: The data sources and profile information mainly come from various platforms such as Reddit. Using their APIs could provide real data (out of scope).

- *Data Visualization Tools* Incorporating data visualization and analysis APIs and libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas will aid in testing phase to generate an more accurate result (out of scope).
