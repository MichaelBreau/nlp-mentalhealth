Many people struggle with mental health issues that go unnoticed, and undiagnosed as well, and are isolated so they never get the diagnosis and the support they need. In response to those two points working in tandem, Dr. Mosserâ€™s past teams, along with support from UQAM and several psychologists from around the world, have developed methods and approaches to assist psychiatrists with diagnosing mental health issues.

As society advances so does the integration of technology into our lives. This social media use represents a body of information that could be used to more efficiently diagnose patients and improve psychologist workloads, in turn helping lessen barriers around seeking treatment.

Utilizing this information effectively requires systems that can process a large amount of data, much of it irrelevant to issue's of mental health, and provide predictions for specific disorders or direct a psychologist towards certain online interactions that may be relevant. This implies the usage of machine learning techniques, and specifically natural language processing techniques, to analyze all this data quickly. The objective of this project is to explore the applications of machine learning to this area of mental health identification.

In order to do this the project will need labelled data to develop models on. This is not easy to find, attempting to collect this ourselves would involve many consent and privacy concerns and be both difficult and time consuming. In order to have easy access to already developed data the team will be joining the "early risk prediction on the internet" competition, or eRisk for short. ERisk is a competition that presents a number of tasks relating to predicting mental health indicators from individuals' online post history with the goal of encouraging research into this area. The competition provides labelled data that models can be trained on as well as a structured environment through which the system developed for this project can be compared to other entries. This provides a golden opportunity for the team to meet their objectives and as such this project will largely be structured around this competition.

Our goal is to help eRisk expand the number of use cases that their NLP systems are applicable for and cover a wider range of scenarios and personal profiles. They have a strong base of NLP systems and data to work with, but the greater the breadth of the research the more people it can help. Early intervention is very important for mental health issues, and for issues such as suicidal tendencies and online predatory tendencies, it can be a matter of life and death. That is why this work is so important, and we will be working on expanding the number of situations in which it will be able to help people.
