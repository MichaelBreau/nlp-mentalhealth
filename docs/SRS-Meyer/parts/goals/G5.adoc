=== (G.5) High-level usage scenarios

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Fundamental usage paths through the system. It presents the main scenarios (use cases) that the system should cover. The scenarios chosen for appearing here, in the Goals book, should only be the **main usage patterns**, without details such as special and erroneous cases; they should be stated in user terms only, independently of the system's structure. Detailed usage scenarios, taking into account system details and special cases, will appear in the System book (<<s4>>)._  <<BM22>>

==== Use Case 1: Process Data
[cols='1,4']
|===
|Goal: |To convert raw language data into a form useable by prediction models
|Actor: |Devloper
|Precondition: |The developer has access to raw language data
|Main Pattern: a|* The developer submits the raw data to the system
* The system returns a processed form of the data usable by pediction models to the developer
|===

==== Use Case 2: Train Model
[cols='1,4']
|===
|Goal: |To train a prediction model using processed data
|Actor: |Devloper
|Precondition: |The developer has access to processed data with expected outputs
|Main Pattern: a|* The developer submits the data and expected outputs to the system
* The system returns a trained prediction model to the developer
* The system returns accuracy measures for the model's predictions on the training data
|===

==== Use Case 3: Predict Risk
[cols='1,4']
|===
|Goal: |To predict a person's mental health risk from new data
|Actor: |Devloper
|Precondition: |The developer has access to a trained prediction model and processed data the model has not seen yet
|Main Pattern: a|* The developer submits the trained model and data to the system
* The system returns predictions of mental health risk for each data point
|===

==== Use Case 4: Measure Accuracy
[cols='1,4']
|===
|Goal: |To compute accuracy measures for predictions made on data
|Actor: |Devloper
|Precondition: |The developer has access to predictions made by a model and the corresponding expected values
|Main Pattern: a|* The developer submits the predictions and expected values to the system
* The system returns a set of accuracy measures for the model's performance
