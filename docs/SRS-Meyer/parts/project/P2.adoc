=== (P.2) Imposed technical choices

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Any a priori choices binding the project to specific tools, hardware, languages or other technical parameters. Not all technical choices in projects derive from a pure technical analysis; some result from company policies. While some project members may dislike non-strictly-technical decisions, they are a fact of project life and must be documented, in particular for the benefit of one of the quality factors for requirements: "requirements must be justified"._  <<BM22>>

From our research and the advice of our supervision team it was determined that the majority of libraries and common tools for natural language processing are written for python. As such the system will be written in python to maximize the number of available techniques that can be explored. This will also allow for easy interoperability with the ops team who have made the choice to use python as well.
