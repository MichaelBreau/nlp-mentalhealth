| Depression Component | must-have | should-have | could-have | won't-have
| The system will divide text into individual units of words and or sub-words (Tokenization). | **x** | | |
| The system will convert generated tokens into lowercase to preserve consistency. | | **x** | |
| The system will remove stopword tokens (Common words that do not commonly have an effect on the meaning). | | **x** | |
| The system will reduce tokens to their root forms (Ex: "moving" to "move"). | | **x** | |
| The system will produce an output that is useable by the Vectorization Component. | **x** | | |
| Anorexia Component | must-have | should-have | could-have | won't-have
| The system will convert tokens into numerical vectors. | **x** | | |
| The system will produce an output that is useable by the Prediction Component. | **x** | | |
| Eating Disorders Component | must-have | should-have | could-have | won't-have
| The system will be able to parse jsonl files of an individual's post history. | **x** | | |
| The system will make predictions given a set of a user's posts. | **x** | | |
| The system will send the predictions to a txt file in the format "{username} {prediction (0-6) for Q1} ... {prediction (0-6) for Q28}" with each individual being on a separate line. | **x** | | |
| The model will outperform guessing all zeros on MAE OR tie MAE and outperform on at least one of the other metrics. | **x** | | |
| The model will outperform guessing all sixes on MAE OR tie MAE and outperform on at least one of the other metrics. | **x** | | |
| The model will outperform guessing the average on MAE OR tie MAE and outperform on at least one of the other metrics. | **x** | | |
