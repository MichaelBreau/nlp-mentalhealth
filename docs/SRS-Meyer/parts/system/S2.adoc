TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**‚Äù. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

This section describes in further detail the components listed in the previous section by describing their functional and non-functional requirements.

**General and Security**

Non-Functional Requirements:

- GR1: The system should be compatible on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
- GR2: Copyrighted content should not be included in the output without reference.
- SR1: The system will be tested periodically to detect a potential lack of processing power.
- SR2: Sensitive user data must not be present within the results generated.

**Text Pre-Processing Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-1: The system will divide text into individual units of words and or sub-words (Tokenization).
- FR-2: The system will convert generated tokens into lowercase to preserve consistency.
- FR-3: The system will remove stopword tokens (Common words that do not commonly have an effect on the meaning).
- FR-4: The system will reduce tokens to their root forms (Ex: "moving" to "move").

**Vectorization Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-5: The system will convert tokens into numerical vectors.

**Model Component**

Functional Requirements:
- FR-6: The system will divide test data into train and test sets.
- FR-7: The system will train the model using corresponding train data set.

**Prediction Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-7: The system will make predictions using the vectorized tokens, the trained model, as well as with the created prediction algorithm.

**Output Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-8: The system will produce output to a specified file with either a range of magnitude or a classification prediction.
- FR-9: If the system is producing an output corresponding to a range of magnitude, it will satisfy the KPI ranges for MZOE and MAE.
- FR-10: If the system is producing an output corresponding to a classification, it will satisfy the KPI range for F-score.
