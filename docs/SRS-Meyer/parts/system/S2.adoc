=== (S.2) Functionality

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**‚Äù. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

This section describes in further detail the components listed in the previous section by describing their functional and non-functional requirements.

**Security**

- SR1: User data must not be shared or re-used in any system not part of this system.
- SR2: Sensitive user data is must not be present within the results generated.
- SR3: The system will be tested periodically to detect crashes and a potential lack of processing power.
- SR4: The system will run through a series of tests before deploying/pushing new builds.
- SR5: The team will regularly push their code by committing to a repository while working on the code.
- SR6: The system will operate using cleaned data that does not contain duplicates.
- SR7: The system data will only operate off of verified data free from copying errors.
- SR8: The system will be tested against plainly appearent data to guide and ensure prediction functionality.


**Text Pre-Processing Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-1: The system will divide text into individual units of words and or sub-words (Tokenization).
- FR-2: The system will convert generated tokens into lowercase to preserve consistency.
- FR-3: The system will remove stopword tokens (Common words that do not commonly have an effect on the meaning).
- FR-4: The system will reduce tokens to their root forms (Ex: "moving" to "move").

Non-Functional Requirements:

- NFR-1: The system will produce an output that is useable by the Vectorization Component.

**Vectorization Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-5: The system will convert tokens into numerical vectors.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- NFR-2: The system will produce an output that is useable by the Prediction Component.

**Prediction Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-6: The system will make predictions using the vectorized tokens, the trained model, as well as with the created prediction algorithm.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- NFR-3: The system will produce an output that is useable by the Output Component.

**Output Component**

Functional Requirements:

- FR-7: The system will produce output to a specified file with either a range of magnitude or a classification prediction.
- FR-8: If the system is producing an output corresponding to a range of magnitude, it will satisfy the KPI ranges for MZOE and MAE.
- FR-9: If the system is producing an output corresponding to a classification, it will satisfy the KPI range for F-score.
