=== (S.2) Functionality

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**‚Äù. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

This section describes in further detail the components listed in the previous section by describing their functional and non-functional requirements.

**Text Pre-Processing Component**

Functional Requirements:

- The system will divide text into individual units of words and or sub-words (Tokenization).
- The system will convert generated tokens into lowercase to preserve consistency.
- The system will remove stopword tokens (Common words that do not commonly have an effect on the meaning).
- The system will reduce tokens to their root forms (Ex: "moving" to "move").

Non-Functional Requirements:

- The system will produce an output that is useable by the Vectorization Component.

**Vectorization Component**

Functional Requirements:

- The system will convert tokens into numerical vectors.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- The system will produce an output that is useable by the Prediction Component.

**Prediction Component**

Functional Requirements:

- The system will make predictions using the vectorized tokens, the trained model, as well as with the created prediction algorithm.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- The system will produce an output that is useable by the Output Component.

**Output Component**

Functional Requirements:

- The system will produce the output of the predictions to the console.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- The system will produce output to the console that is understandable by the project team.
