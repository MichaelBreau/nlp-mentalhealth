\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The end goal of the team this year will be to complete and submit a working model during the 2024 eRisk competition. No information regarding the tasks to be completed during the competition are released until it starts. The primary challenge the team will face prior to the start of the competition will be gaining the knowledge of natural language processing necessary to build a successful model during the competition. The main risk the team faces during this time is being unprepared for the competition.

During the proof of concept demonstration the team plans to present a successful recreation of this past eRisk submission: \url{https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2936/paper-83.pdf}. The goal is to demonstrate how much the team has learned and to set a clear timeline for where the team's knowledge should be in November.

%What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
%demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
%you will be able to overcome this risk?
