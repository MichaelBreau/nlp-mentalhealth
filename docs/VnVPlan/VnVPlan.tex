\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
  
\subsubsection{Models}

A model is any part of the system, usually placed after data pre-processing, that \textit{learns} to map an input to an output through an algorithm. Examples include word embedding models like word2vec, topic models like LDA, and neural networks. It is not yet clear what model will be used in the final implementation, a set of potential model types and respective tests will be presented here. New potential methods will be included when learned by the team, and what model will be used in the final implementation will be indicated when that is determined.

\myparagraph{Vector Embedding Models}

Vector embedding models take a set of inputs and produce a vector for each one. Examples include word2vec, which learns to map a set of words to a vector space that encodes information like similarity (ie. synonyms) and opposites (ie. man vs woman) into vector operations; and LDA, which learns to map a set of documents to a vector space where each dimension represents a topic like science or sports. These models typically can not represent new, unseen inputs within the vector space, only those inputs they were trained on.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FRT-VEC1-1\\}

Control: Automated
					
Initial State: The model has not yet been trained
					
Input: A set of properly processed inputs into the model
					
Output: A set of vectors, all with the same dimensionality, with each corresponding to an input

Test Case Derivation: The output is what the model should create upon successful training
					
How test will be performed: The model will be trained on the properly processed inputs, a script will then run on the output to insure all inputs are included and all vectors have the correct dimensions

\item{FRT-VEC1-2\\}

Control: Manual
					
Initial State: The model has not yet been trained
					
Input: A set of properly processed inputs into the model
					
Output: A set of vectors, with some concept of similarity encoded into proximity within the vector space

Test Case Derivation: The output is what the model should create upon successful training
					
How test will be performed: The model will be trained on the properly processed inputs, a test input will be chosen by a tester and the 5 vectors with the smallest angle between itself and the test input's vector will be found by a script. The tester will then manually check that these 5 vectors' corresponding inputs are similar to the test input (ie. similar topics, words are related to eachother, etc.)

\item{FRT-VEC1-3\\}

Control: Manual
					
Initial State: The model has not yet been trained
					
Input: A set of properly processed inputs into the model
					
Output: A set of vectors, with some concept of similarity encoded into proximity within the vector space

Test Case Derivation: The output is what the model should create upon successful training
					
How test will be performed: The model will be trained on the properly processed inputs, a test input will be chosen by a tester and the 5 vectors with the largest angle between itself and the test input's vector will be found by a script. The tester will then manually check that these 5 vectors' corresponding inputs are unrelated to the test input (ie. entirely different topics, words are unrelated to eachother, etc.)

\subsubsection{Prediction Formulation}

Prediction formulation is everything involved in transforming model outputs to the specific values asked for by the eRisk competition (ie. survey answers, most concerning sentences, a risk percentage). This component does not handle converting these values into the correct data format for submission to eRisk, only deriving the values eRisk is interested in. Both what values will be asked for and what models will be used are both unknown as of now so it is largely unknown what this component of the system will involve.

\item{FRT-PF1-1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: The system's models have been trained and their outputs for test data derived
					
Input: The model's outputs into the prediction formulation component
					
Output: A set of values in the form asked for by the eRisk competition

Test Case Derivation: The system should output predictions in the form specified by eRisk, it is not guaranteed the model outputs will be in this form, this component needs to convert them properly
					
How test will be performed: Model outputs will be fed to the formulation component, it's output will be run through a script that checks that all necessary values as outlined by eRisk are present.

\subsubsection{Output Formatting}

Output formatting is what writes the final predictions into the data format required by eRisk. This format is not yet known so the specifics of this component are currently vague.

\item{FRT-OF1-1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Final predictions been derived
					
Input: Final predictions into the output formatting component
					
Output: The final predictions formatted to the data type required by the eRisk competition

Test Case Derivation: It is necessary to convert predictions to the right file format to ensure successful submission to the eRisk competition
					
How test will be performed: Final predictions will be fed to the output formatter, a script will be run on the output to ensure it's formatting matches what is required by eRisk.
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
