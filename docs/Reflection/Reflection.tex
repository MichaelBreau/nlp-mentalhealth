\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board)
Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based on your reflections.}


\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}


\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}






\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback
from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}


\subsection{SRS and Hazard Analysis}


\begin{enumerate}
   \item SRS:
   \item Hazard Analysis:
       For this report we utilized a lot of high quality feedback from our professor and TA. The first major concern we
       addressed from there feedback was making it explicit what was in scope for this project. There was also the point
       made that they thought we could come up with more hazards to identify and once we read this, we actually came up
       with a couple of different new hazards to add that we previously did not think of. Lastly there was the correction
       we added from the feedback about ensuring we have all terms we used defined and also following their advice to make
       our recommended action more detailed and less vague. We also implemented one main change based on group 8s feedback,
       specifically about SR1. We used there feedback to realize that we needed to add clarity to SR1 to include and explicitly
       mention the idea of not sharing data online or exposing it to third-party sites.
   \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Design and Design Documentation}


\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}


\begin{enumerate}
   \item VnV Plan:
   \item VnV Report:
       A good piece of feedback we got from group 8 for our VnV Report was to add something into our automated testing section to
       mention how we used a linter and Github actions in our implementation because this would fall under this category.
   \end{enumerate}






\section{Design Iteration (LO11)}


\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?}


\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}


\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?}


\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}


\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential
users currently exist?}


\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}


\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}


\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}


\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan,
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the
technology you planned on using?}


\subsection{What Went Well?}


\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and
technology?}


\subsection{What Went Wrong?}


\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}


\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}


\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}
