\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board)
Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

\subsection{SRS and Hazard Analysis}

\subsection{Design and Design Documentation}

\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11)}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

The target market  for an Natural Language Processing system capable of detecting depression, anorexia and eating disorders is large, namely due to the growing acknowledgement and importance of the mental health problems. To market this product, targeting healthcare professionals, mental health organizations, clinics staff and/or individuals or relatives who seek support would be carried out. The cost factors of a sell-able version would include development, testing and on-going maintenance, which could fall into the moderate to more significant category depending on the complexity and scale of the system. The pricing, most likely would depend on the target market and the value promised.  If we plan to further maintain and develop this product into something that could actually be used by real life users, then we could charge a monthly or yearly subscription fee per user registered. \\ To make a profit of units sold should be larger than the total production and marketing costs. If the project uses the open-source model and would not to be sold to the public, attracting users along the help of community engagement, collaborations with mental health experts, and making the system available for researchers and professionals will be possible. This audience is potentially the most big and diversified because it comprises healthcare providers, people with mental health disorders, researchers, and educators.

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

If given the opportunity to work on a similar project which would require the coordination of 2 independent groups, we feel that the best course of action would be to be more strict with our merging timelines in order to foster better results for everyone. Earlier stages of the project's development lost valuable time when there weren't clear boundaries and roles of how the teams would interact. Both teams were so focused on managing their immediate responsibilities that less emphasis was put on the bigger picture, so that when the time came for the systems to start integration both teams realized that valuable time and effort was misplaced either doing overlapped responsibilities, or creating systems that would require some reworking in order to work within the other team's design constraints. Overall, better communication would lead to stronger team synergy, and less misplaced effort that could be better directed at making a more efficient project.

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}
